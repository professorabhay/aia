# Memify 

## Meme NFT Marketplace with Auctions and Bidding

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) for minting, selling, and auctioning meme NFTs on the AIA blockchain. Users can mint memes as NFTs, list them for sale, and participate in bidding auctions, with payments in AIA tokens. The DApp is built using React, Vite, and Web3, and connects to a smart contract on the AIA blockchain to facilitate secure transactions and ownership transfers for each NFT.
